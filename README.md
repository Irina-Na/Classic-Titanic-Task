Will Leonardo Dicaprio died? Machine Learning from Disaster

This is the legendary Titanic ML competition – the best, first challenge to dive into ML competitions.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. 

Overview

The data has been split into two groups:

    training set (train.csv)
    test set (test.csv)

The training set should be used to build machine learning models. For the training set, Kaggle provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. 
Model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. Need to use feature engineering to create new features.
The test set should be used to see how well model performs on unseen data. For the test set, Kaggle do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. 
It is job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, need use the model trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
